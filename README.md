# Mr.Robot
A series of projects that I am making with my web development journey, each level has a new set of concepts and ideas that I implement along the way.

## Level - 1
Nothing fancy here, pretty basic HTML & CSS including
- Positioning
- ID
- Classes
- Div

## Level - 2
Levelling up a little, learned bootstrap and implemented the following concepts
- Wireframing
- Bootstrap Grid System
- Containers
- Carousel
- Cards
- Media Query Breakpoints
- Responsiveness
